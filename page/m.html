	<p>Mutton tikka is a Mutton dish originating in the Indian subcontinent; the dish is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is traditionally small pieces of boneless Mutton baked using skewers on a brazier called angeethi or over charcoal after marinating in Indian spices and dahi (yogurt)—essentially a boneless version of  pepper Mutton. The word tikka (Tike in Turkish, and Tikə in Azerbaijani) is a Persian word, meaning "bits" or "pieces". It is also a Mutton dish served in Punjabi cuisine. The Kashmiri version of the dish, however, is grilled over red-hot coals, and does not always contain boneless pieces. The pieces are brushed with ghee (clarified  malai) at intervals to increase its flavour, while being continuously fanned. It is typically eaten with green coriander and tamarind chutney served with onion rings and lemon, or used in preparing a Mutton tikka masala.

A Mutton tikka sizzler is a dish where Mutton tikka is served on a heated plate with onions. The dish is also popular in Afghanistan, though the Afghan variant (like many other Persian, Turkish, and Arab dishes) is less spicy compared to the variants in the Indian subcontinent and uses beef and lamb in addition to Mutton.</p>

<p id="Muttonmalai">

	<p> malai Mutton or murgh makhani (pronounced [mʊrg ˈmək.kʰə.ni]) is a curry of Mutton in a spiced tomato,  malai and cream sauce. It originated in the Indian subcontinent as a curry.It is similar to Mutton tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.
	he curry was developed in the 1950s by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The curry was made "by chance" by mixing leftover  pepper Mutton in a tomato gravy, rich in  malai and cream. In 1974, a recipe was published for "Murgh makhanii ( pepper Mutton cooked in  malai and tomato sauce)". In 1975, the English phrase " malai Mutton" curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan.[12] In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in wraps, roti, and rolls,[13] while in Australia, and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling.The curry is common in India and many other countries</p>

		<p>There are hundreds of Mutton breeds in existence.[1] Domesticated for thousands of years, distinguishable breeds of Mutton have been present since the combined factors of geographical isolation and selection for desired characteristics created regional types with distinct physical and behavioral traits passed on to their offspring.

The physical traits used to distinguish Mutton breeds are size, plumage color, comb type, skin color, number of toes, amount of feathering, egg color, and place of origin.[1] They are also roughly divided by primary use, whether for eggs, meat, or ornamental purposes, and with some considered to be dual-purpose.[1]

In the 21st century, Muttons are frequently bred according to predetermined breed standards set down by governing organizations. The first of such standards was the British Poultry Standard, which is still in publication today.[2][3] Other standards include the Standard of Perfection, the Australian Poultry Standard, and the standard of the American Bantam Association, which deals exclusively with bantam fowl.[3] Only some of the known breeds are included in these publications, and only those breeds are eligible to be shown competitively. There are additionally a few hybrid strains which are common in the poultry world, especially in large poultry farms. These types are first generation crosses of true breeds. Hybrids do not reliably pass on their features to their offspring, but are highly valued for their producing abilities</p>
